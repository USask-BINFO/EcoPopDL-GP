# EcoPopDL-DP Framework

## Overview
EcoPopDL-DP is a comprehensive framework for environmental-aware and population-informed genomic prediction using deep learning and ChromoMap. It is designed to address challenges in predicting complex traits influenced by genotype-by-environment and genotype-by-location interactions in resource-limited breeding populations. The framework integrates genomic, population structure, and environmental data to improve predictive accuracy for complex traits such as yield, flowering time, and seed weight.

## Features
- **ChromoMap:** A visual-spatial representation of SNP-level genomic variation, chromosome structure, and positional relationships.
- **Deep Learning Integration:** Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and trait prediction.
- **Linear Mixed Model (LMM):** Captures both fixed and random effects to refine predictions and improve interpretability.
- **Hybrid Framework:** Combines CNN-derived features with LMM for improved genomic prediction performance.
- **Data Augmentation and Transfer Learning:** Enhances model generalizability and robustness with advanced techniques.

## Workflow
1. **Preliminary Data Processing:**
    - **Input Data:** Genotypic data, phenotypic data, and environmental variables.
    - **Genotypic Data Processing:** Minor allele frequency (MAF) filtering and linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning.
    - **Phenotypic Data Processing:** Normalization and outlier removal.
2. **Genetic Ancestry Analysis:**
    - Incorporates unsupervised and supervised admixture analysis to derive genetic ancestry profiles.
    - Integrates population clusters into predictive models.
3. **Prediction Model Design:**
    - **ChromoMap Generation:** Encodes SNPs into a color-coded image representing the genome.
    - **CNN Architecture:** Leverages EfficientNet-B0 for trait prediction.
    - **Feature Engineering:** Extracts and integrates genomic and metadata features.
    - **Linear Mixed Model:** Adds environmental covariates and population structure.
4. **Benchmarking:**
    - Compares against baseline models such as GBLUP, RRBLUP, Bayesian Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and SVM.
